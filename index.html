            <p align="justify">The Red Fort or<i> Lal Qila </i>is a historic fort in the Old Delhi, that historically
                served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the
                Red Fort on 12th May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and
                white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal.On 15
                August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the Indian flag above the
                Lahori Gate. Every year on Independence Day (15 August), the Prime Minister hoists the Indian Tricolour
                Flag at the fort's main gate and delivers a nationally broadcast speech.</p>

            <p align="justify">The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in
                Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan
                (1628â€“1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan
                himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 42-acre complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house,
                and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall. Construction of the mausoleum
                was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10
                years.</p>

            <p align="justify">Mysore Palace, also known as Amba Vilas Palace, is a historical palace and a royal
                residence. It is located in Mysore, Karnataka, India. It used to be the official residence of the
                Wadiyar dynasty and the seat of the Kingdom of Mysore. The palace is in the centre of Mysore, and faces
                the Chamundi Hills eastward. Mysore is commonly described as the 'City of Palaces', and there are seven
                palaces including this one. However, the Mysore Palace refers specifically to the one within the new
                fort. Mysore Palace is a splendid example of Indo-Saracenic architecture designed by British architect
                Henry Irwin and built in 1912.</p>

                The structure was built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai
                Singh, the founder of the city of <i>Jhunjhunu</i> in the state of Rajasthan. He was so inspired by the
                unique structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and historical palace. It was designed by Lal
                Chand Ustad. Its five-floor exterior is akin to a honeycomb with its 953 small windows called Jharokhas
                decorated with intricate latticework. </p>

                markets surrounding the structure, and has become one of the most frequented tourist attractions in
                Hyderabad. Charminar is also a site of numerous festival celebrations, such as Eid-ul-adha and Eid

                sculptures described as among the finest surviving examples of ancient Indian art, particularly
                expressive paintings that present emotions through gesture, pose and form. The Ajanta Caves constitute

                Khajwa, 9km from Rajnagar and 49 km from district headquarter Chhatarpur. The temples are famous for
                their nagara-style architectural symbolism and a few erotic sculptures. Most Khajuraho temples were
                built between 885 CE and 1000 CE by the Chandela dynasty. When these monuments were built, the boys in
                the place lived in hermitages, by being <i>Brahmcharis</i> until they attained manhood and these
                sculptures helped them to learn about the worldly role of 'householder'.</p>
